## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Type Romaji**: Type the reading of a character (e.g., `ka`, `shi`, `tsu`) to deal a card.
2.  **Build a Hand**: Cards will pile up in the center. Try to type words or sentences!
3.  **Mistakes?**:
    - press **`Backspace`** to undo the last card.
    - press **`Space`** to clear the table and start over.

## ✨ Features

-   **Poker Style UI**: Beautiful card design with a felt table background.
-   **Katakana Mode**: Hold `Shift` or use CapsLock to deal **Katakana** cards.
-   **Red Mode**: Type `0` (zero) before a character to make it **Red** (e.g., `0ka` -> Red `か`).
-   **Romaji Reveal**: The Romaji hint on a card is hidden until you deal the *next* card, helping you focus on the Kana first.
-   **Sound Effects**: Satisfying card snap and shuffle sounds (requires one click to enable).
